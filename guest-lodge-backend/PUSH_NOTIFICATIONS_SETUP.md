## API Endpoints

Returns the VAPID public key for client subscription

### POST `/api/push/subscribe` (Requires Auth)
Subscribes a device to push notifications
```json
{
  "endpoint": "https://fcm.googleapis.com/...",

  "auth": "base64-encoded-key",
  "source": "funnel"
}
```

## Notification Trigger

Notifications are automatically sent when:
- A booking payment succeeds (via Stripe webhook)
- Shows: Guest name, room type, and total amount
- Links back to /funnel when clicked

## Troubleshooting

**"Push notifications not supported on this device"**
- You're on iOS Safari (not supported by Apple)
- Try Chrome on Android or desktop instead

**Notifications not showing up**
- Check browser notification settings
- Make sure the 🔔 button shows "On" (green)
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify VAPID keys are set in environment

**Service worker not registering**
- Check `/sw.js` is accessible
- Must be served over HTTPS (or localhost)
- Clear browser cache and try again

## Next Steps

1. Add the VAPID keys to your production environment
2. Deploy the changes
3. Enable notifications on your devices
4. Enjoy real-time booking alerts! 🎉
